                        <p>Nielsen's legacy Salesforce environment had grown organically across regions and business units, resulting in fragmented data, inconsistent processes, and poor cross-cloud visibility. Teams across Sales, Service, and Marketing were operating in silos, with no unified view of the customer. The platform had accumulated significant technical debt, making it difficult to scale or integrate new acquisitions.</p>

                        <p>The agency's existing grants process relied on a patchwork of legacy tools, manual review workflows, and disconnected databases. Grant applications were processed inconsistently across divisions, with limited visibility into status, compliance, or funding allocation. The lack of a centralized platform made it difficult to track outcomes, enforce accountability, or generate the reporting required by oversight bodies.</p>

Built a custom data model to track the full grants lifecycle — from application intake through review, award, disbursement, and close-out. Developed an Experience Cloud portal for external applicants to submit, monitor, and manage their grant applications in real time. Implemented role-based approval workflows with configurable review stages, scoring rubrics, and compliance checkpoints. Integrated document management capabilities to handle supporting materials, audit trails, and version-controlled submissions. Built reporting dashboards for program officers to monitor funding pipelines, flag at-risk grants, and generate compliance reports. Designed the architecture to accommodate multiple grant programs with distinct rules, timelines, and funding sources within a single platform instance.</p>

Compliance reporting that previously required weeks of manual compilation was reduced to on-demand dashboard generation. The Experience Cloud portal significantly improved the applicant experience, reducing submission errors and support inquiries. The platform is now used across multiple divisions and serves as the foundation for future grants program expansion.</p>

                        <p>The Town of Cary, NC was experiencing growing pressure on its citizen services operations. Residents expected faster response times and more accessible channels for requests ranging from utility inquiries to permitting questions. The existing Service Cloud setup handled case management, but lacked intelligent automation and self-service capabilities. Staff were manually triaging and routing a high volume of repetitive inquiries, creating bottlenecks during peak periods and limiting the team's capacity for complex, high-touch requests.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="case-study-pso__block">
                        <span class="case-study-pso__label">Solution</span>
                        <p>Implemented Salesforce Agentforce to augment the Town's existing Service Cloud environment with AI-powered autonomous agents. Designed and configured Agentforce topics and actions tailored to common citizen service scenarios — including utility account inquiries, public works requests, and general information lookups. Built structured grounding data sources and integrated them with the Agentforce reasoning engine so the AI agent could retrieve accurate, context-specific answers without hallucination. Configured multi-turn conversational flows that allowed the agent to gather required information, validate inputs, and execute actions such as case creation, appointment scheduling, and status lookups. Established escalation protocols so the AI agent seamlessly transferred to human agents when confidence thresholds were not met or when the citizen explicitly requested human assistance. Implemented an analytics layer to track agent resolution rates, escalation patterns, and citizen satisfaction, providing continuous feedback for optimization.</p>

                        <p>Launched one of the earlier municipal Agentforce deployments, positioning the Town of Cary as a forward-looking adopter of AI in public-sector service delivery. The AI agent now handles a substantial share of inbound citizen inquiries autonomously, dramatically reducing the volume of cases requiring human intervention. Average resolution times for routine inquiries dropped significantly, and citizen satisfaction with digital interactions improved measurably. The deployment freed staff capacity to focus on complex cases and proactive community engagement. The analytics framework provides ongoing visibility into AI agent performance, enabling iterative improvements to topics, actions, and grounding data.</p>

                        <p>Yellowstone Club, an exclusive private residential community and ski resort in Montana, was managing its member relationships, real estate sales pipeline, and concierge operations across disconnected systems and manual processes. The membership team lacked a unified view of member profiles, property interests, and engagement history.

Personalized marketing communications drove significantly higher open and engagement rates compared to previous batch-send approaches. Internal teams gained a 360-degree member view for the first time, improving the quality and consistency of member interactions across departments. The platform positioned the club to operate with the digital sophistication expected by its membership while preserving the personal, high-touch character that defines the institution.</p>

                        <p>Pharmedium, a leading provider of outsourced compounding services for hospitals, was managing its sales territory assignments and account ownership through a combination of manual spreadsheets and ad hoc Salesforce configurations. As the company scaled, this approach created mounting issues: territory overlaps led to duplicated outreach, reassignment lag caused gaps in account coverage during rep transitions, and leadership lacked reliable visibility into territory-level pipeline and performance. The absence of a structured territory model made it difficult to plan capacity, balance workloads, or respond to organizational changes without significant manual effort.</p>

                        <p>Implemented Salesforce Enterprise Territory Management to replace the manual, spreadsheet-driven process with a structured, rules-based system. Designed a hierarchical territory model aligned to Pharmedium's sales organizational structure, incorporating geographic, account-type, and segment-based assignment rules. Configured territory assignment rules to automatically route accounts to the correct territory and rep based on defined criteria, eliminating manual reassignment. Built reporting and dashboards to provide territory-level pipeline visibility, coverage analysis, and performance benchmarking for sales leadership. Established a governance process for territory realignment — enabling leadership to model proposed territory changes, assess impact on pipeline distribution, and execute adjustments with minimal disruption.</p>

                        <p>Replaced a fragile, manual territory process with a scalable, automated system that improved account coverage and reduced assignment conflicts. Territory realignments that previously took weeks of manual coordination were completed in a fraction of the time. Sales leadership gained reliable territory-level visibility for the first time, enabling better capacity planning and more informed go-to-market decisions. The structured model also simplified onboarding for new reps, who could immediately inherit the correct accounts and pipeline context for their assigned territory.</p>

                        <p>Breckenridge Grand Vacations (BGV), a vacation ownership and hospitality company, was managing customer interactions across sales, service, and marketing through a fragmented set of tools and manual workflows. Customer data was siloed between departments, preventing a unified view of the guest journey. Sales teams lacked pipeline visibility, service teams operated without complete interaction histories, and marketing relied on batch communications with no behavioral targeting. The disconnected tech stack made it difficult to deliver the cohesive, personalized guest experience that drives loyalty and repeat engagement in the hospitality sector.</p>

Configured Sales Cloud to support the vacation ownership sales pipeline with custom stages, automated follow-ups, and tour scheduling workflows.

Integrated Marketing Cloud to enable personalized, journey-based communications triggered by guest behavior, ownership milestones, and engagement patterns.

                        <p>Huizenga Group, a diversified holding and investment company, was managing its deal pipeline and investment tracking through an inconsistent mix of Salesforce configurations, spreadsheets, and informal processes. Different business units had adopted their own opportunity stages, naming conventions, and tracking methods, making it nearly impossible for leadership to get a reliable, consolidated view of the pipeline. Forecasting was manual and unreliable, and there was no standardized process for tracking deal progression, investment milestones, or portfolio performance across the group's various verticals.</p>
